# Machine Learning Applications

## Overview

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow by solving three real-world business problems using classification, recommendation systems, and clustering techniques.

The project covers:

- Data preparation and cleaning
- Feature scaling
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Classification
- Recommendation Systems
- Clustering
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization
- Business interpretation

# Project 1: Wine Classification

## Business Problem

A premium wine distributor needs to automatically classify wines based on their chemical properties for inventory management and quality control.

## Machine Learning Workflow

- Data Cleaning
- StandardScaler
- PCA
- GridSearchCV
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Results

- Accuracy: **100%**
- PCA retained **96.29%** of the original information.

### Confusion Matrix

# Project 2: Feed Recommendation System

## Business Problem

Recommend similar livestock feeds using chicken growth performance.

## Machine Learning Workflow

- Data Cleaning
- StandardScaler
- PCA
- Cosine Similarity

## Results

The recommendation system successfully identified feed types with similar performance characteristics.

# Project 3: Crime Pattern Clustering

## Business Problem

Identify patterns in crime statistics across U.S. states to support public policy research.

## Machine Learning Workflow

- StandardScaler
- Feature Selection
- PCA
- K-Means
- Gaussian Mixture Model
- Elbow Method
- Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

## Results

PCA retained **93.89%** of the dataset variance.

Both K-Means and GMM identified **2 natural crime clusters**.
